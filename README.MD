## MODERN WEB DEVELOPMENT

front End : client side of the web app:what your user can see and interact with
Back End : server scripting of the web app:database infrastructure,server script
Middleware service : APIs application programming interface : system that allows two or more software to communicate with each other
## Data flow
1. Static data : data resides within the project structure of web application
2. dynamic data : database within the connected server / 2. other server that are not part of the current web app (API service)
Front End(request for data) -> directly(frameworks(Django,flask))or Middleware service (API) <- Backend (respond back to F .F with data request)
### coding languages
Front End - a.HTML-Hyper text markup language(language for web)-structure of a web appkication
b.CSS -cascading stylsheet (language we use to style HTML structure-define the web layouts for our webapp)
c.JS- add interactivity/dynamism to a website-DOM-document object

Back End - a .python -server scripting language-execute operation from backend 

### framework - Backend

Django - python based framework

### version control
- reference to how we store and manage our source code projects
- git - software that handles version control
- github.com -platform that offer GUI for git operation
- gitlab.com -enterprise level
- bitbucket.org -attlassian

### Terminal
- this is what we use to communicate to our computers , git operations
